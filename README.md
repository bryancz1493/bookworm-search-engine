# MERN Challenge: Book Search Engine

My task is to allow my app to function like a search engine by using Google Books API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API with Apollo server. MERN stack, React as front end, MongoDB as database, Node.js/Express.js server and API.

# User Story

* AS a Bootcamp developer
* I WANT to search for new book to read during free time
* SO THAT I can keep a list at my cart for future purchase

# Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I load the search engine
* THEN I am presented a menu with options to search for books and sign in/sign up
* WHEN I click the search button
* THEN I can input in the textbox field to search
* WHEN I click sign in/sign up button
* THEN I can either sign up as a new user or sign in as existing user
* WHEN I am logged in 
* THEN I can view my saved book list and cart for futher purchase
* WHEN I click on remove button
* THEN the book will be deleted from the list
* WHEN I click logout
* THEN I will be shown logged out and only display the search button

# Mock-Up
